### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a [staff scientist](https://acceleration.utoronto.ca/researcher/sterling-baird) within the Acceleration Consortium's AI & automation lab ("SDL0"), my focus is on adaptive experimentation. I implement software-orchestrated, human-in-the-loop, high-impact Bayesian optimization workflows that run 24/7 across each of our labs.

Previously, I directed the training programs at Acceleration Consortium (AC) including the [AC Training Lab](https://ac-training-lab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [AC Microcourses](https://ac-microcourses.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [workshops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVaWl2tL06c&ab_channel=TaylorSparks), [AC Hackathons](https://ac-bo-hackathon.github.io/), seminars, and outreach. I helped build solutions for deployment to the AC's core labs (~30 full-time staff scientists) and the broader ecosystem.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering from the University of Utah in 2023 in Dr. Taylor Sparks' materials informatics group, where I used machine learning to discover new materials for energy and structural applications. I obtained my M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from Brigham Young University in 2021, where I conducted hydrogen diffusivity experiments in metals and developed grain boundary property prediction models. I obtained my B.Sc. in Applied Physics from Brigham Young University in 2018, where I conducted experimental research on lithium-sulfur batteries using structurally modified carbon-nanotubes.

A popular saying that resonates with me is: "give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe." Unlike an axe which dulls with each blow, research skills are often transferable to other "research trees". Eventually, axes are replaced by chainsaws and chainsaws by [tigercats](https://www.tigercat.com/), where tasks that once took hours and days now take only minutes and seconds. I've witnessed this as I've invested time in learning hardware and software automation skills and leveraging state-of-the-art algorithms in data science.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Honegumi](https://honegumi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a template generator for Bayesian optimization scripts and [microcourses for self-driving labs](https://ac-microcourses.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning authentication protocols ([temporary access credentials via JWT and HiveMQ](https://accelerated-discovery.org/t/assigning-temporary-credentials-for-remote-access-to-equipment/241)) for access to remote equipment
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on advanced Bayesian optimization topics such as high-dimensional, multi-objective, and multi-task Bayesian optimization with a focus towards materials applications
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help - [come to the Acceleration Consortium](https://airtable.com/appzY4NgJDC7vmDcz/pagCMbfwd3SwphG6A/form) and build out hardware and software solutions for autonomous experiments

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

A popular logging saying goes "give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe."

Eventually, axes are replaced by chainsaws and chainsaws by [tigercats](https://www.tigercat.com/), where tasks that once took hours and days now take only minutes and seconds.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [advanced Bayesian optimization (BO)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL0SWcFqypClTIMQDOs_Jug70qaVPOzEc) and [self-driving labs](https://github.com/sparks-baird/self-driving-lab-demo)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [PyScaffold](https://pyscaffold.org/en/stable/) and related best practice workflows
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on applying advanced BO to real-world chemistry and MatSci tasks as well as [self-driving lab demos](https://github.com/sparks-baird/self-driving-lab-demo)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with [adaptive materials design benchmarks](https://github.com/sparks-baird/optimization-benchmark) similar to [Matbench](https://matbench.materialsproject.org/)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about [tips, tricks, and tools](https://github.com/sparks-baird/auto-paper) to automate research tasks

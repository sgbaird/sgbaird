### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I studied Applied Physics and M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from Brigham Young University in 2018 and 2021 for my bachelor's and master's degrees, respectively. I did my Ph.D. with Dr. Taylor Sparks in Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Utah in 2023, focusing on materials informatics. Currently, I direct the training programs at [Acceleration Consortium](https://acceleration.utoronto.ca/) (AC) including the [AC Training Lab](https://ac-training-lab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [AC Microcourses](https://ac-microcourses.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [workshops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVaWl2tL06c&ab_channel=TaylorSparks), [AC Hackathons](https://ac-bo-hackathon.github.io/), seminars, and outreach.

For fun, here's popular saying that resonates with me: "give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe." To expand a bit, unlike an axe which dulls with each blow, research skills are often transferable to other "research trees". Eventually, axes are replaced by chainsaws and chainsaws by [tigercats](https://www.tigercat.com/), where tasks that once took hours and days now take only minutes and seconds.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [advanced Bayesian optimization](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL0SWcFqypClTIMQDOs_Jug70qaVPOzEc) and [self-driving labs](https://github.com/sparks-baird/self-driving-lab-demo)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [model deployment via HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces-overview) and [the Adaptive Experimentation (Ax) Platform](https://ax.dev/)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on advanced Bayesian optimization applied to real-world materials science tasks (see [Honegumi](https://honegumi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) and the creation of [low-cost self-driving labs](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/654e5f25dbd7c8b54b063ab3) for research and education, such as with [AC Microcourses](https://ac-microcourses.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help building out the [Acceleration Consortium (AC) Training Lab](https://ac-training-lab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

A popular logging saying goes "give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe." Unlike an axe which dulls with each blow, research skills are often transferable to other "research trees". Eventually, axes are replaced by chainsaws and chainsaws by [tigercats](https://www.tigercat.com/), where tasks that once took hours and days now take only minutes and seconds.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [advanced Bayesian optimization](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL0SWcFqypClTIMQDOs_Jug70qaVPOzEc) and [self-driving labs](https://github.com/sparks-baird/self-driving-lab-demo)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [the Adaptive Experimentation (Ax) Platform](https://ax.dev/)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on advanced Bayesian optimization applied to real-world materials science tasks (see [Honegumi](https://honegumi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) and the creation of [low-cost self-driving labs](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/654e5f25dbd7c8b54b063ab3) for research and education, such as with [AC Microcourses](https://ac-microcourses.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help building out the Acceleration Consortium (AC) Training Lab
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about [tips, tricks, and tools](https://github.com/sparks-baird/auto-paper) to automate research tasks
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: sterling.baird@utoronto.ca
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to breakdance
